* Async await is ntg but a syntax sugar i.e it makes syntax of using promises a bit more easier
Internally async await is transpiled into promises

* Any kind of event listener(button.eventlistener=function) or timer function will move to task queue(call
back queue)

*Task queue consists of call backs of asynchronous function and event handlers , micro task queue consists of
all the call backs from promises and single event loop is present which handles micro task queue first
and then goes to call back or task queue

*Call stack                Micro stack Queue           Call back queue        UI queue




UI  queue will wait until micro task queue gets empty
Rendering can only happen when micro task queue gets empty
