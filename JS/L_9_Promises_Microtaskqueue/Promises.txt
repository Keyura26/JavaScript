Asynchronous programming is a backbone for JS based stack
There are 3 ways to use async function in JS
1.Call backs
2.Promises (these are improvement over callbacks)
3.Async await (is just syntax sugar over promises)


// Promises are most difficult concept when it comes to JS
//Promises is a part of Java script , its just like a Data structure
//The actual outcome of a promise will be determined by the function that will give you the promise

//Initially value will be undefined and state will also be as pending in promises

//After the task is done  value will be filled and state is set as fulfilled fulfilled
