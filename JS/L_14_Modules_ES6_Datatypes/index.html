        <!-- normally adding 
        if a fn or variable/fn is declard in the one script
        then that var/fn  can be accessed
        --> 

        <!-- <script src="lib.js" ></script> 
        <script src="client.js" ></script>  -->
         <!-- here client.js is accessed after lib.js so every variable and function available in lib.js 
        is accessed in client.js -->
        <!-- Block scope and function scope are considered accross the files -->


          <!--Issues
        * if a fn or variable/fn is declard in the one script
          then that var/fn  can be accessed.
        * abstraction of each   
          Modules were introduced
  to make use of abstraction(hide properties of one file and they cannot be accessed into other) use modules
  for that we use type=module  -->
