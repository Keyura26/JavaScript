JS is a multi paradigm language i.e there are multiple ways of doing the thins and all these ways arecombined together and used in end product
Immutable means there is no scope of change i.e not changing a particular object

* All the 4 ways of creating object in JS weren't originally available in the language
1st way - Object Literal
2nd way - Function constructor
object.create was added to overcome the limitation of first 2 ways
class constructor was added because of some accomodations


*Whenever we use new Person in code , Class Person creates an empty object and this in the person class refers to empty
object and we fill the object and return the object over to variable keyura , there is no need of any explicit return

*If we dont use new while creating object , it is a normal function call and since we are not using
any return statement the variable keyura becomes undefined

* class is basically a abstraction layer over normal function constructor

*Function constructor with the help of new is an abstraction of giving an empty object and automatically
gives the filled object to that variable

*Function gives a object using the new keyword

*We cannot create any private variable when it comes to JS as bydefault there is no inbuilt feature to create
private variable in JS because we dont have internal objects we create objects from object
