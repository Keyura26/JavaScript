Asynchronous conept is an essential concept in JS

//As setTimeOut is not a part of JS so it will go to Web API region

//When browser sees that setTimeout is called it will move it from there and send it to Web API area

//If we have any other task that is coming from Web API it can only come to the JS stack when my
//call stack is empty this is how architecture is designed

//With any environment unless the call stack is empty we cannot put any function into it even If
//1 sec has been completed

//1.JS only gives logic
//2.Asynchronous function is given by environment
//3.As soon as it sees call of async function it moves it to Web API area and then code will execute
//4.This async function only  comes back to call stack when the call stack is empty

//The person who controls the crowd, controls the queue that they just enter sequently only after the
//call stack is empty is the event loop

//Asynchronous architecture of browser and same goes for node js

//JS is just a engine which provides user logic ,
 it is a single thread(means only provides the logic doesn't know most of the things)

 //When any asynchronous function comes in the call stack it moves into Web API

 //As soon as wait is over in Web Api for a asynchronous function then call backs are enqueued
  into call back queue for wait purpose

  //event loop coordinates between call back queue and call stack as soon as call back queue gets empty
  it pushes elements of call back queue into call stack
