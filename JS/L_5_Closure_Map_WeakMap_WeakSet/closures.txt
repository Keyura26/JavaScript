If we dont have any variable in current scope we should go to function definition where code is written
and we will look outside of that

Inorder to use closure the outer variable we want to use should be in the lexical scope

*Closure is just an extension of lexical scope

*When we do hoisting part at that point of time count will be inside closure

*When JS gives memory to a function , that function forms closure with any outer variable
that are there- closure witn only variable not value

*Closure is ntg but a storage where count variable is stored

*When outer function is invoked count got its memory undefined and inner function got the memory and it was put to the heap
at that time inner function forms closure with count and ofcourse outer variable should bein lexical scope.

*greeter function will also get the access of closure of getFirstName function too

*Closure is ntg but if we have any variable outside the function it will haveaccess to that variable
